aws-java-backup - command line tools for copying S3 buckets and SimpleDB dbs to another account
---------------

Example use cases:

  - You have production data in a S3 / SimpleDB AWS account that you want to copy to a private account whose keys
    are not on your production servers

  - You want to backup/restore data for dev purposes

Requirements:

    JDK 1.6
    Maven 2

Building:

    mvn compile
    mvn assembly:single
       This will produce: aws-backup-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Running:

  - To sync a S3 bucket to another bucket, possibly in a different AWS account:

    java -cp aws-backup-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.bitmechanic.aws.SyncBuckets \
       --from accessKey:secretKey:bucketName --to accessKey:secretKey:bucketName [--verbose]

    If the bucketName specified in --to does not exist, it will be created.

    CAREFUL: Any objects in --to that are NOT in --from will be removed.  This command makes --to and --from identical.


  - To copy a SimpleDB domain to another domain, possibly in a different AWS account:

    java -cp aws-backup-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.bitmechanic.aws.CopySimpleDB \
       --from accessKey:secretKey:domain --to accessKey:secretKey:domain [--verbose]

    The domain specified in --to will be DELETED and CREATED.
    All items in --from will be copied into --to
